I"Ÿ<p>Applications control transactions mainly by specifying when a transaction starts and ends. This can be specified by using either Transact-SQL statements or database application programming interface (API) functions. The system must also be able to correctly handle errors that terminate a transaction before it completes. By default, transactions are managed at the connection level. When a transaction is started on a connection, all Transact-SQL statements executed on that connection are part of the transaction until the transaction ends. However, under a multiple active result set (MARS) session, a Transact-SQL explicit or implicit transaction becomes a batch-scoped transaction that is managed at the batch level. When the batch completes, if the batch-scoped transaction is not committed or rolled back, it is automatically rolled back by SQL Server.</p>

<p><b>Explicit Transactions</b>
An explicit transaction is one in which you explicitly define both the start and end of the transaction through an API function or by issuing the Transact-SQL BEGIN TRANSACTION, COMMIT TRANSACTION, COMMIT WORK, ROLLBACK TRANSACTION, or ROLLBACK WORK Transact-SQL statements. When the transaction ends, the connection returns to the transaction mode it was in before the explicit transaction was started, either implicit or autocommit mode.</p>

<p><b>Implicit Transactions</b></p>

<p>When a connection is operating in implicit transaction mode, the instance of the SQL Server Database Engine automatically starts a new transaction after the current transaction is committed or rolled back. You do nothing to delineate the start of a transaction; you only commit or roll back each transaction. Implicit transaction mode generates a continuous chain of transactions. Set implicit transaction mode on through either an API function or the Transact-SQL SET IMPLICIT_TRANSACTIONS ON statement. This mode is also known as Autocommit OFF.</p>

<p><b>Autocommit</b><b> Transactions</b></p>

<p>Autocommit mode is the default transaction management mode of the SQL Server Database Engine. Every Transact-SQL statement is committed or rolled back when it completes. If a statement completes successfully, it is committed; if it encounters any error, it is rolled back.</p>

<p><b>Batch-scoped Transactions</b></p>

<p>Applicable only to multiple active result sets (MARS), a Transact-SQL explicit or implicit transaction that starts under a MARS session becomes a batch-scoped transaction. A batch-scoped transaction that is not committed or rolled back when a batch completes is automatically rolled back by SQL Server.</p>

<p><b>Distributed Transactions</b></p>

<p>Distributed transactions span two or more servers known as resource managers. The management of the transaction must be coordinated between the resource managers by a server component called a transaction manager.</p>

<p><b>Prepare phase</b></p>

<p>When the transaction manager receives a commit request, it sends a prepare command to all of the resource managers involved in the transaction. Each resource manager then does everything required to make the transaction durable, and all buffers holding log images for the transaction are flushed to disk. As each resource manager completes the prepare phase, it returns success or failure of the prepare to the transaction manager.</p>

<p><b>Commit phase</b></p>

<p>If the transaction manager receives successful prepares from all of the resource managers, it sends commit commands to each resource manager. The resource managers can then complete the commit. If all of the resource managers report a successful commit, the transaction manager then sends a success notification to the application. If any resource manager reported a failure to prepare, the transaction manager sends a rollback command to each resource manager and indicates the failure of the commit to the application.</p>

<p><b>Ending Transactions</b></p>

<p>You can end transactions with either a COMMIT or ROLLBACK statement, or through a corresponding API function.</p>

<p><b>COMMIT</b></p>

<p>If a transaction is successful, commit it. A COMMIT statement guarantees all of the transactionâ€™s modifications are made a permanent part of the database. A COMMIT also frees resources, such as locks, used by the transaction.</p>

<p><b>ROLLBACK</b></p>

<p>If an error occurs in a transaction, or if the user decides to cancel the transaction, then roll the transaction back. A ROLLBACK statement backs out all modifications made in the transaction by returning the data to the state it was in at the start of the transaction. A ROLLBACK also frees resources held by the transaction.</p>

<p><b>Errors During Transaction Processing</b></p>

<p>If an error prevents the successful completion of a transaction, SQL Server automatically rolls back the transaction and frees all resources held by the transaction. If the clientâ€™s network connection to an instance of the SQL Server Database Engine is broken, any outstanding transactions for the connection are rolled back when the network notifies the instance of the break. If the client application fails or if the client computer goes down or is restarted, this also breaks the connection, and the instance of the SQL Server Database Engine rolls back any outstanding connections when the network notifies it of the break. If the client logs off the application, any outstanding transactions are rolled back.</p>

<p>If a run-time statement error (such as a constraint violation) occurs in a batch, the default behavior in the SQL Server Database Engine is to roll back only the statement that generated the error. You can change this behavior using the SET XACT_ABORT statement. After SET XACT_ABORT ON is executed, any run-time statement error causes an automatic rollback of the current transaction. Compile errors, such as syntax errors, are not affected by SET XACT_ABORT. For more information, see SET XACT_ABORT (Transact-SQL).</p>

<p>When errors occur, corrective action (COMMIT or ROLLBACK) should be included in application code. One effective tool for handling errors, including those in transactions, is the Transact-SQL TRYâ€¦CATCH construct. For more information with examples that include transactions, see TRYâ€¦CATCH (Transact-SQL). Beginning with SQL Server 2012 (11.x), you can use the THROW statement to raise an exception and transfers execution to a CATCH block of a TRYâ€¦CATCH construct. For more information, see THROW (Transact-SQL).</p>

<p><b>Compile and Run-time Errors in </b><b>Autocommit</b><b> mode</b></p>

<p>In autocommit mode, it sometimes appears as if an instance of the SQL Server Database Engine has rolled back an entire batch instead of just one SQL statement. This happens if the error encountered is a compile error, not a run-time error. A compile error prevents the SQL Server Database Engine from building an execution plan, so nothing in the batch is executed. Although it appears that all of the statements before the one generating the error were rolled back, the error prevented anything in the batch from being executed. In the following example, none of the INSERT statements in the third batch are executed because of a compile error. It appears that the first two INSERT statements are rolled back when they are never executed.</p>
