title: Temporal tables or system-versioned temporal tables is a database feature that allow SQL Server to automatically keep history of the data in the table. A system-versioned table allows you to query updated and deleted data, while a normal table can only return the current data.  Temporal tables or system-versioned tables are an example of an assertion table, meaning that it captures the lifetime of a record based on the physical dates the record was removed or updated. Temporal tables currently do not support versioning, meaning the versioning of records based on logical dates Temporal tables are not a replacement for the change data capture (CDC) feature. CDC uses the transaction log to find the changes and typically those changes are kept for a short period of time (depending on your ETL timeframe). Temporal tables store the actual changes in the history table and they are intended to stay there for a much longer time.
